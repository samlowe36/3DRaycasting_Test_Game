# Raycasting_Test_Game
trying to put together a 3d game in pygame with raycasting
modeled after the original Doom
idea and assistance from the youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECqUrT7IdqQ&list=WL&index=1&t=68s&ab_channel=CoderSpace

it is finished for the time being. thanks again to the Coder Space youtube channel and I think I learned a lot about pygame following along with this. May continue to tinker with the basic concept in the future
